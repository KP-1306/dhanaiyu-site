# DhanAIyu — Website Starter (Next.js App Router + Tailwind)

## Quick start
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000
3. Edit copy in `app/**/page.tsx`. Replace logo in `/public/logo.png`.
4. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify.

## Notes
- AI‑forward copy included across pages.
- Forms are static placeholders (connect to email/Sheet later).
- Tailwind utility classes for fast iteration.
