      <h1>Privacy Policy ‚Äî DhanAIyu</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

      <p>
        At <strong>DhanAIyu</strong>, your privacy and trust are our top priorities.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your
        personal information when you use our platform, website, and mobile
        applications (collectively ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        DhanAIyu (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) is a healthcare technology platform
        designed to simplify doctor appointments, queue tracking, and health record
        management for patients and clinics. We operate as a booking and
        coordination platform ‚Äî not a medical service provider.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect minimal and purpose-specific data to deliver the best user experience.</p>
      <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Name, phone number, and OTP verification (for secure access).</li>
        <li>Appointment preferences, selected doctors, and booking details.</li>
        <li>Health-related information voluntarily entered (e.g., prescriptions, test reports).</li>
        <li>Clinic or hospital registration data (for verified professionals).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Location data (only with your explicit consent).</li>
        <li>Usage logs and interaction analytics (to improve performance and reduce wait-time prediction errors).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>c. Third-Party Data</h3>
      <p>
        If you use integrated features (e.g., Google Maps for ETA, or payment gateways),
        some data may be shared with those partners under their respective privacy terms.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Our AI &amp; Data Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Automated Decision-Making:</strong> AI predictions are supportive only;
          final scheduling decisions remain human-controlled by clinics or staff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>De-identification:</strong> Health and queue data are stripped of identifiers
          before being analyzed or stored for model training.

      </ul>
